Tom hope you have a good time out east. I bet its really clean and trouble
free when compared to our cities. I've spotted a couple of hotels and flights
for Jan 2011 as a two week package for about 2200 all in (flight/hotel) but we
could come over in October or November if convenient can you recommend
anywhere? I hear the water is OK to drink-make sure you get enough and don't
go hungry. J
