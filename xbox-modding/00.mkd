So what was all this about TL? Do you enjoy working stuff out? How did you get
introduced to the world of technical computer manipulation? And would you be
able to install my new Athlon XP 2600+? (its too tricky for me, what with
removing the motherboard and the importance of precise heat sink placement).
And T-Bird - cool website.
